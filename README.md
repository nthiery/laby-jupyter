# Laby-Jupyter: Learn programming, playing with ants and spider webs ;-) In Jupyter :-)

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nthiery/laby-jupyter/master?filepath=notebooks).

[Laby](https://github.com/sgimenez/laby/issues/52) is an introductory
coding game, where the learner (from six years old on) solves puzzles
by guiding -- with code -- a lost ant out labyrinths riddled with
deadly obstacles. This is nothing but the good old pedagogical concept
of turtle; but gamified with a well conceived sequence of puzzles
guiding the learner through the basic concepts of imperative
programming.

Laby-Jupyter is a (partial) reimplementation of Laby, as a Jupyter-based web application.
Here is some [context and motivation](https://github.com/sgimenez/laby/issues/52).

Credits for all the artwork and puzzles goes to the original Laby
authors! Thank you for making this possible by sharing your work !!!
